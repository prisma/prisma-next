# migration-graph-rendering

Redesign of the `migration graph` (Tier 3) command's rendering: a condensed,
deterministic, annotated node-link diagram that draws **contracts as nodes and
migrations as edges**, with complete back-edges, replacing the current dagre
layout and its golden-path root/tip selection.

Tracking ticket: [TML-2746](https://linear.app/prisma-company/issue/TML-2746).
Sits on the consolidated tolerant graph model (TML-2739); see that project for
the multi-root / multi-tip / cyclic graph reasoning this layout consumes.

## Contents

- [`mockups.md`](./mockups.md) — **the locked visual language.** Hand-drawn
  layout mockups across the full fixture set plus synthetic pathologicals, with
  the layout rules the renderer must implement. This is the design of record.
- [`prototype/`](./prototype) — zero-build prototyping harness used to settle
  the design. `proto.mjs` loads every fixture under
  `examples/prisma-next-demo/migration-fixtures`, recomputes topology in plain
  JS, runs a pluggable `render()`, and writes `gallery.md`. Run from the repo
  root: `node projects/migration-graph-rendering/prototype/proto.mjs`.

The harness is throwaway exploration; the real renderer will consume the
consolidated model rather than recomputing topology. `mockups.md` is the
durable artifact — it carries the visual contract into implementation.
