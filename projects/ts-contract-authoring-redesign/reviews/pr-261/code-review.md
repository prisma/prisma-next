# Code Review — PR #261 (Re-review)

**PR**: [feat(contract-ts): [DRAFT] design new contract.ts](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-next/pull/261)
**Spec**: [projects/ts-contract-authoring-redesign/spec.md](projects/ts-contract-authoring-redesign/spec.md)
**Branch**: `feat/contract-ts-revamp` → `main`
**Files changed**: 108 files, +14 318 / −817
**Re-review date**: 2026-04-02
**Previous review**: Initial review identified 26 findings (F01–F26). This re-review assesses which have been addressed.

---

## Summary

Since the initial review, 15 of 26 findings have been resolved and 2 partially resolved. The most impactful fixes: demo contract now uses typed refs (F01), `any` type aliases replaced with safe wide types (F02), field preset types and runtime logic deduplicated (F05, F10), `as unknown as` casts documented (F06), `applyNaming` edge-case tests added (F07), `BuiltStagedContract` renamed to `SqlContractResult` (F14), emitter output deterministically sorted (F17), JSDoc restored on framework component interfaces (F20), self-referential/circular relation tests added (F25), and several nits cleaned up (F11, F12, F22, F23, F24).

**Remaining**: 1 deferred finding (F15 — contract representation convergence, deferred to contract-domain-extraction M5). All blocking and non-blocking concerns have been resolved.

## What Looks Solid

- **Clean intermediate representation**: `SqlSemanticContractDefinition` is a minimal, well-typed interface boundary between authoring and the existing builder. It cleanly decouples the staged surface from `SqlContractBuilder` internals and opens the door for alternative authoring surfaces.

- **Pack-driven vocabulary**: Field presets and type constructors are genuinely derived from pack descriptors rather than hand-maintained. The composition in `composed-authoring-helpers.ts` correctly merges target + extension namespaces with conflict detection and prototype-pollution guards.

- **Thorough validation and error messages**: The lowering pipeline validates identity conflicts, duplicate table/column mappings, missing FK targets, arity mismatches, and named constraint collisions — all with clear, actionable error messages.

- **TS ↔ PSL parity proof**: The `ts-psl-parity.test.ts` fixture is a strong design proof — it lowers equivalent TS and PSL contracts and asserts structural equality on the output.

- **Fallback warning system**: `staged-contract-warnings.ts` emits diagnostics when authors use string-based refs where typed model tokens are available. The batching threshold keeps noise manageable.

- **Type-level design**: The `SqlContractResult<Definition>` type (renamed from `BuiltStagedContract`) computes storage tables, mappings, and column types from the definition's generic parameter, preserving full type inference for downstream `schema()`/`sql()` usage without manual annotation.

- **Self-referential and circular relations**: Now tested with dedicated cases (self-referential Category with parent/children, circular Employee ↔ Department), confirming lazy token resolution works correctly.

- **Deduplicated type utilities**: `FieldBuilderFromPresetDescriptor` and related helper types extracted to `authoring-type-utils.ts`, eliminating duplication between staged DSL and composed helpers.

## Blocking Issues

All resolved.

## Non-Blocking Concerns

---

### F15 — Contract representations are converging from opposite sides (deferred)

**Status**: DEFERRED (by design — to contract-domain-extraction project, Milestone 5)

**Location**: [packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/semantic-contract.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/semantic-contract.ts); [packages/1-framework/1-core/shared/contract/src/domain-types.ts](packages/1-framework/1-core/shared/contract/src/domain-types.ts)

**Issue**: Unchanged. `SqlSemanticContractDefinition` is acceptable as a stepping stone.

## Resolved Findings

The following findings have been fully addressed since the initial review.

| ID | Title | Resolution |
|----|-------|------------|
| F01 | Demo contract uses string-based `namedType` refs | Now uses typed refs: `field.namedType(types.user_type)`, `field.namedType(types.Embedding1536)` |
| F02 | `any` type aliases in test files | Replaced with concrete wide types: `StagedModelBuilder<string \| undefined, Record<...>, ...>` |
| F03 | `contract-builder.ts` is 1,890 lines and growing | Reduced to 782 lines after extractions |
| F04 | `SemanticContractBuilder` type erasure | `SemanticContractBuilder` no longer exists |
| F05 | Duplicated `FieldBuilderFromPresetDescriptor` types | Extracted to shared `authoring-type-utils.ts` |
| F06 | `as unknown as` casts lack justification comments | Block comment in `build()` preamble covers the cluster; `SemanticContractBuilder` cast already had one |
| F07 | `applyNaming` lacks dedicated unit tests | `describe('applyNaming')` block added with edge cases: all-uppercase, single char, empty string, digit boundaries, etc. |
| F08 | PSL interpreter changes are large and inline | Extracted `processEnumDeclarations`, `resolveNamedTypeDeclarations`, and `buildSemanticModelFromPsl` helper functions; main function reduced from ~587 to ~90 lines |
| F09 | No ADR for the staged DSL design decision | ADR 181 documents the staged contract DSL |
| F10 | Duplicated `buildFieldPreset` logic | Unified — `composed-authoring-helpers.ts` now imports `buildFieldPreset` from `staged-contract-dsl.ts` |
| F11 | `Defined<T> = Present<T>` unnecessary alias | `Defined<T>` removed; `Present<T>` used consistently |
| F12 | `typecheckOnly` variable unused | Now used in conditional guards for type-only test cases |
| F13 | Field presets bypass pack composition | Presets now live in `packages/2-sql/9-family/src/core/authoring-field-presets.ts`; bare `field` export in `staged-contract-dsl.ts` contains only structural helpers (`column`, `generated`, `namedType`) |
| F14 | `BuiltStagedContract` leaks authoring-surface identity | Renamed to `SqlContractResult<Definition>`; `isStagedContractInput` removed from public exports |
| F16 | No-emit flow regressed: bracket access and emitted types | No-emit context uses `typeof contract`; query files use `sql.post` dot access; ORM wired via `createOrmClient` |
| F17 | Model ordering changed in emitted `contract.d.ts` | Emitter now sorts model/table entries with `localeCompare` for deterministic output |
| F18 | Demo uses N+1 query pattern instead of ORM | ORM wired in no-emit path via `createOrmClient`; `users-with-posts` command uses `include` pattern |
| F19 | Authoring types in `framework-components.ts` | `AuthoringContributions` extracted to `framework-authoring.ts`; remaining `authoring?` field on `ComponentMetadata`/`PackRefBase` is integral to the interface |
| F20 | Doc comments removed from public framework component interfaces | JSDoc restored on `ComponentDescriptor`, `FamilyDescriptor`, `TargetDescriptor`, and other descriptor interfaces |
| F21 | Test timeout increases may signal type regression | Timeouts at standard values: default 100ms, typeScriptCompilation 8s; `TEST_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER` env var available for scaling |
| F22 | Redundant `collect()` helper | Removed; demo uses `Promise.all` with `await` directly |
| F23 | Use `ifDefined()` utility for conditional spread | `ifDefined()` now used in both `instantiateAuthoringFieldPreset` and `buildFieldPreset` |
| F24 | pgvector parity fixture split is unclear | Comment added explaining `embedding1536Type` vs `embedding1536Column` split |
| F25 | Self-referential and circular model relations untested | Tests added: self-referential Category (parent/children) and circular Employee ↔ Department |
| F26 | No ORM client coverage in the no-emit path | `users-with-posts` command added to `main-no-emit.ts` exercising ORM via `createOrmClient` + `include` |

| 7 | Explicit reverse/query-surface relations with singular owning-side FK | `rel.belongsTo()` owns FK, `rel.hasMany()`/`rel.hasOne()` are reverse-side in [staged-contract-dsl.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/staged-contract-dsl.ts) lines 1304–1427; FK only generated from `belongsTo` `.sql({ fk })`.

| 8 | Postgres→SQLite portability within ~10% changes | Target-specific code isolated to import and `.sql()` blocks | [contract-builder.staged-contract-dsl.portability.test.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/test/contract-builder.staged-contract-dsl.portability.test.ts) — explicit portability test comparing Postgres and SQLite contracts |
| 9 | Downstream `schema()`/`sql()`/`orm()` inference works from no-emit | `SqlContractResult<Definition>` computes full contract type from definition generic in [contract-builder.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/contract-builder.ts) lines 662–687 | Integration type tests (`contract-builder.types.test-d.ts`); `expectTypeOf` assertions in staged DSL tests. No-emit demo uses dot access (`sql.post`), `typeof contract`, and `createOrmClient` with `include` patterns |
| 10 | Lowering pipeline can derive model/client helper types | `SqlSemanticContractDefinition` captures all model/field/relation data needed for type derivation in [semantic-contract.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/src/semantic-contract.ts) | Structural coverage via [contract-builder.semantic-contract.test.ts](packages/2-sql/2-authoring/contract-ts/test/contract-builder.semantic-contract.test.ts); type inference proven in staged DSL type tests |
