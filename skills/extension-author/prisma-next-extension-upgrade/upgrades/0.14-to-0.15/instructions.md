<!--
TML-2787 (M:N slice 3): namespace-scoped execution-default refs land in
`@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` (nested writes through a junction, the
required-payload gate, and the namespace-keyed `ExecutionMutationDefault.ref`).
The changes are internal to the ORM client and its emitted-contract consumption;
the extension-author surface is unchanged. No extension-author action — re-emit
picks up the new contract ref shape. Incidental substrate diff only.
