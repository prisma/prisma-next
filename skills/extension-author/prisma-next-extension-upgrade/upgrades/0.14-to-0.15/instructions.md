<!--
TML-2787 (M:N slice 3): namespace-scoped execution-default refs land in
`@prisma-next/sql-orm-client` (nested writes through a junction, the
required-payload gate, and the namespace-keyed `ExecutionMutationDefault.ref`).
The changes are internal to the ORM client and its emitted-contract consumption;
the extension-author surface is unchanged. No extension-author action — re-emit
picks up the new contract ref shape. Incidental substrate diff only.

<!--
TML-2919: typed-DDL conversion of the not-null-with-temporary-default recipe (slice
1 of the typed-DDL migration-ops project). The recipe's ADD COLUMN execute step
now lowers a typed `PostgresAlterTable` DDL node through the adapter, with the
temporary backfill value carried as a `FunctionColumnDefault` — so the emitted
DEFAULT clause parenthesizes its expression (e.g. `DEFAULT ('')` instead of the
previous `DEFAULT ''`). Semantically identical in PostgreSQL. The recipe's DROP
DEFAULT step also routes through a new typed `DropDefaultAction`. The pgvector
`planner.behavior.test.ts` assertion that pins the recipe's emitted ADD COLUMN
SQL was updated to the parenthesized form. Test-only assertion update — no
extension-author API change. Incidental substrate diff only. (The 0.13 → 0.14
counterpart entry already records the same change; this entry covers the same
substrate diff against the post-0.14.0 main.)
