<!--
TML-2891 (eliminate the SQL family placeholder namespace): app authors who build
contracts through the public facades / target `defineContract` wrappers
(`@prisma-next/postgres`, `@prisma-next/sqlite`) are unaffected — those wrappers
supply the now-required `createNamespace` factory, so no app-author code changes.
The only `examples/` diff is regenerated migration `end-contract.d.ts` snapshots
whose SQL namespace `kind` changed from `'sql-namespace'` to `'postgres-schema'`;
the next `contract emit` picks this up automatically, and historical migration
snapshots are type-only (the runtime reads `contract.json`, which already carried
`postgres-schema`). No app-author action. Incidental substrate diff only.
-->

<!--
TML-2868 (Postgres RLS slice 1): adds the additive Postgres row-level-security
authoring feature (PSL `policy_select` blocks lower to RLS policies; `db verify`
diffs them, scoped to the namespaces a contract owns). The `examples/supabase/*`
touches — re-emitted `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts` / `contract.prisma`, the
`profile-queries.ts` demo, and the `skeleton.integration.test.ts` walking
skeleton — only demonstrate the new feature plus merge regeneration. RLS is opt
in; existing schemas without `policy_*` blocks emit and verify unchanged. No user
upgrade action — re-emit picks up the contract shape. Incidental substrate diff
only.
-->

<!--
TML-2795: the `prisma-next-demo` example gains a Post<->Tag many-to-many. The demo
authors the relation in PSL (with a re-baselined `add_post_tags` migration), switches
its id fields to native uuid storage for M:N parity, and adds M:N ORM examples, CLI
commands, seed data, and PGlite integration coverage. Demonstrates the many-to-many
authoring surface that slice 5 (TML-2794) added to the framework; the example diff
spans `examples/prisma-next-demo/**` only. Additive and opt-in — no existing consumer
contract changes shape and no migration is forced. No consumer action required.
Incidental substrate diff only.
