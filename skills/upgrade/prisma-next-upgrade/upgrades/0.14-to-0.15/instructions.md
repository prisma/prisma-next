TML-2868 (Postgres RLS slice 1): adds the additive Postgres row-level-security
authoring feature (PSL `policy_select` blocks lower to RLS policies; `db verify`
diffs them, scoped to the namespaces a contract owns). The `examples/supabase/*`
touches — re-emitted `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts` / `contract.prisma`, the
`profile-queries.ts` demo, and the `skeleton.integration.test.ts` walking
skeleton — only demonstrate the new feature plus merge regeneration. RLS is opt
in; existing schemas without `policy_*` blocks emit and verify unchanged. No user
upgrade action — re-emit picks up the contract shape. Incidental substrate diff
only.

<!--
TML-2886 (redo, PR #841): type SQL enum columns via a baked storage column lookup.
The SQL emitter now generates a top-level `StorageColumnTypes` map keyed
`[namespace][table][column]`; `FieldOutputTypes`/`FieldInputTypes` are derived from
it at emit time. The query builder (sql-builder) reads `StorageColumnTypes` directly;
the ORM still reads `FieldOutputTypes`. `contract.json` and both hashes are
byte-identical; `FieldOutputTypes` is byte-identical to main. The examples/ diff is
purely `.d.ts` regeneration (the new `StorageColumnTypes` block added; observable
types unchanged). No consumer action required. Incidental substrate diff only.
