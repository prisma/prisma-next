TML-2891 (eliminate the SQL family placeholder namespace): app authors who build
contracts through the public facades / target `defineContract` wrappers
(`@prisma-next/postgres`, `@prisma-next/sqlite`) are unaffected — those wrappers
supply the now-required `createNamespace` factory, so no app-author code changes.
The only `examples/` diff is regenerated migration `end-contract.d.ts` snapshots
whose SQL namespace `kind` changed from `'sql-namespace'` to `'postgres-schema'`;
the next `contract emit` picks this up automatically, and historical migration
snapshots are type-only (the runtime reads `contract.json`, which already carried
`postgres-schema`). No app-author action. Incidental substrate diff only.
-->

<!--
TML-2868 (Postgres RLS slice 1): adds the additive Postgres row-level-security
authoring feature (PSL `policy_select` blocks lower to RLS policies; `db verify`
diffs them, scoped to the namespaces a contract owns). The `examples/supabase/*`
touches — re-emitted `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts` / `contract.prisma`, the
`profile-queries.ts` demo, and the `skeleton.integration.test.ts` walking
skeleton — only demonstrate the new feature plus merge regeneration. RLS is opt
in; existing schemas without `policy_*` blocks emit and verify unchanged. No user
upgrade action — re-emit picks up the contract shape. Incidental substrate diff
only.
-->

<!--
TML-2931 (Postgres RLS migration seam): internal refactor of how the RLS schema
diff is represented — policies nest under a table node, the framework differ keys
nodes by an `id()` path rather than an entity coordinate, and `SchemaDiffIssue`
carries `path` instead of `coordinate`. The only `examples/` touch is
`examples/supabase/test/skeleton.integration.test.ts`, which reads a diff issue's
subject differently (`issue.path` instead of `issue.coordinate`). The RLS
schema-diff surface is still in development (not a stable shipped API), and the
authored RLS feature behaviour is unchanged. No user upgrade action. Incidental
substrate diff only.
-->

<!--
TML-2795: the `prisma-next-demo` example gains a Post<->Tag many-to-many. The demo
authors the relation in PSL (with a re-baselined `add_post_tags` migration), switches
its id fields to native uuid storage for M:N parity, and adds M:N ORM examples, CLI
commands, seed data, and PGlite integration coverage. Demonstrates the many-to-many
authoring surface that slice 5 (TML-2794) added to the framework; the example diff
spans `examples/prisma-next-demo/**` only. Additive and opt-in — no existing consumer
contract changes shape and no migration is forced. No consumer action required.
Incidental substrate diff only.

<!--
TML-2886 (redo, PR #841): type SQL enum columns via a baked storage column lookup.
The SQL emitter now generates a top-level `StorageColumnTypes` map keyed
`[namespace][table][column]`; `FieldOutputTypes`/`FieldInputTypes` are derived from
it at emit time. The query builder (sql-builder) reads `StorageColumnTypes` directly;
the ORM still reads `FieldOutputTypes`. `contract.json` and both hashes are
byte-identical; `FieldOutputTypes` is byte-identical to main. The examples/ diff is
purely `.d.ts` regeneration (the new `StorageColumnTypes` block added; observable
types unchanged). No consumer action required. Incidental substrate diff only.
-->

<!--
TML-2884 (PR #834): end-to-end MongoDB enum enforcement via `$jsonSchema`.
The `mongo-demo` example gains a `UserRole` enum field (`role` on `users`),
authored in both PSL and the TypeScript builder. The planner-generated migration
applies a `collMod` with a `$jsonSchema` validator that enforces the enum values
at the MongoDB layer. Three migration `end-contract.d.ts` / `start-contract.d.ts`
snapshots were also updated for the TML-2891 `'mongo-namespace'` → `'mongo-database'`
kind rename. Re-emit picks up the new contract shape automatically; no consumer
action required. Incidental substrate diff only.
-->

# Upgrade 0.14 → 0.15

No consumer-facing action is required for this transition.

The diff under `examples/` (and the example migration snapshots) is incidental —
emitted contract artefacts (`contract.json` / `contract.d.ts`) were regenerated
for two internal substrate changes:

- **Scalar-list storage machinery.** The emitted contracts now carry the
  adapter-reported `scalarList` capability marker and the bumped envelope
  version. The scalar-list machinery threaded through this release is internal —
  no authoring path emits a list storage column yet, so generated types and
  runtime behaviour for existing schemas are unchanged.
- **Namespace-scoped execution-default refs (M:N).** The contract's
  `ExecutionMutationDefault.ref` now carries a `namespace` alongside `table` and
  `column`, so an execution-time mutation default is keyed by
  `(namespace, table, column)`, disambiguating same-named tables across
  namespaces. The runtime applies defaults by namespace transparently.

No user action — a re-emit picks up the new contract shape.

<!--
Exercise Mongo enums in retail-store (this PR): the retail-store example now imports
the standalone `mongoEnums(...)` export from `@prisma-next/mongo/runtime` to replace
order-type string literals with typed enum accessors (`enums.OrderType.members.Delivery`/
`.Pickup`). The `MongoClient` facade also gains a direct `db.execute(plan)` method and
a `db.raw` property (both additive). None of these changes affect the emitted contract
shape; a re-emit picks them up automatically. No user action required. Incidental
substrate diff only.
