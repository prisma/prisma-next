    summary: |
      Committed migration contract snapshots move from per-package sibling files
      (`start-contract.json` / `start-contract.d.ts` / `end-contract.json` /
      `end-contract.d.ts`) and per-space head copies
      (`migrations/<space-id>/contract.json` / `contract.d.ts`) into a single
      content-addressed store per migrations root, at
      `migrations/snapshots/<hex>/contract.json` + `contract.d.ts`, where `<hex>`
      is the contract's storage hash with the `sha256:` prefix stripped. Every
      distinct contract is stored once, however many migrations reference it.
      Every emitted `migration.ts` now imports its bookend contracts from the
      store (`../../snapshots/<hex>/contract.json`, `../../snapshots/<hex>/contract.d.ts`)
      instead of from sibling files in its own directory.
      This is a clean break: there is no fallback reader for the old sibling-file
      layout, so a committed migrations tree that has not been converted fails to
      load once you upgrade — `migration plan` / `migration new` / `migrate` /
      `migration check` all read contract snapshots through the store only, and
      a missing store entry fails with `MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SNAPSHOT_MISSING`
      naming the expected hash and path. `migration.json` / `ops.json` /
      `migrationHash` are unaffected — the contract snapshot was never part of
      migration identity, so converting the layout changes no migration's hash.
      To convert an existing project, run the migrator once per migrations root
      from a checkout of the `prisma/prisma-next` repository at (or above) the
      version you're upgrading to: `node scripts/migrate-migrations-layout.mjs
      [migrationsRoot...]` (with no arguments it auto-discovers every migrations
      root under the current directory). Per migration package, it reads
      `migration.json`, write-if-absents the destination contract (and the
      source contract, when present) into the store under the matching hash,
      rewrites the committed `migration.ts` import specifiers, and deletes the
      four sibling files. Per contract space, it store-writes any remaining
      per-space `contract.json` / `contract.d.ts` keyed by that space's
      `refs/head.json` hash, then deletes it. It asserts every contract's inner
      `storage.storageHash` against the hash it's filed under before writing
      anything (mismatch aborts the whole run, nothing is deleted), and
      re-verifies every `migrationHash` is unchanged after conversion. Run it,
      review the diff, then `pnpm typecheck` (or your project's equivalent) to
      confirm every rewritten `migration.ts` import resolves.
    detection:
      glob: "**/migration.ts"
      contains:
        - "./start-contract.json"
        - "./end-contract.json"
        - "./start-contract'"
        - "./end-contract'"
