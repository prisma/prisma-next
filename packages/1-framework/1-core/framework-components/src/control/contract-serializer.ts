 * Framework SPI for moving a contract between its canonical on-disk JSON
 * form and its in-memory class-hierarchy form. Both directions live on the
 * same SPI so the conceptual seam — "the boundary where the contract
 * crosses between persisted JSON and live class instances" — has a single
 * named home.
 *
 * Both faces are needed by the framework today (round-trip property tests,
 * drift detection, future canonicalization), not eventually. For most
 * targets `serializeContract` is identity over JSON-clean class instances;
 * the method exists because the seam is real, not as a convention placeholder.
 *
 * Implementers compose this SPI as a named property on their target
 * descriptor (`descriptor.contractSerializer`); the descriptor itself
 * remains the aggregator of all per-target SPIs.
