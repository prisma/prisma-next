 * SQL Schema IR represents the actual database state as discovered by
 * introspection (the parallel to SQL Contract IR, which represents the
 * desired state).
 *
 * The discriminator is installed as a non-enumerable own property,
 * matching the SqlNode pattern. This keeps `JSON.stringify(node)`
 * canonical (no `kind` field), keeps `toEqual({...})` test assertions
 * against pre-lift flat shapes passing, and keeps `node.kind` readable
 * for dispatch.
 *
 * Both `kind` and `nodeKind` are required: every concrete leaf is a node
 * the generic differ can pair and compare, so every leaf must declare which
 * node it is. `nodeKind` has no default here — every direct subclass sets its
 * own literal value (the relational leaves via `RelationalSchemaNodeKind`,
 * target concretions via their own vocabulary, e.g. `PostgresSchemaNodeKind`).
